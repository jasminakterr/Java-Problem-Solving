# Java Problem Solving

Welcome to the **Java Problem Solving** repository! This repository contains a collection of Java solutions to various algorithmic and programming problems. It is designed to help programmers of all levels improve their problem-solving skills and coding abilities, specifically in Java.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasminakterr/Java-Problem-Solving.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

        cd Java-Problem-Solving

3. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from browswer.

## Usuage

1. After cloning the repository, you can explore the problem solutions located in individual .java files within the project.

2. To compile and run any solution, use the following commands:

     `javac ProblemName.java`    # To compile the solution
   
     `java ProblemName`          # To run the compiled solution

4. Each solution is written in a way that it can be run independently to test its correctness.
